For lagging students
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Any 10 problems from http://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC . You can use http://codeforces.com/problemset/customtest or any other online/offline editor to write your codes, and once compiled/tested, you can submit them against the problem statement.

(2) Any 10 problems from https://www.codechef.com/problems/school?sort_by=SuccessfulSubmission&sorting_order=desc . You can use https://www.codechef.com/ide to write your codes. Enter "Practice" in ContestName textbox and enter the Problem Code in the next textbox and click on "Select", you'll see the problem statement there itself. Once you compile/test your code, you can submit them then and there itself and get the response verdict. Note that it’s mandatory to provide custom input in codechef IDE to execute the code. The “Run” button does not run the code agaisnt sample IO.

[For points, (1) and (2), if you are unable to solve a problem within 30 minutes, skip it and move to the next problem. The more problems you solve from the above, the more comfortable you'll get in online problem-solving skills.]
